                 Flutio Installation


Flutio is built and installed with a dead simple Makefile.
Open and edit it if none of the options described here
fixes your problem.


These commands could be enought for a debian based system:

    $ sudo apt install build-essential \
                       tcl8.6-dev \
                       libsndfile1-dev \
                       libsamplerate0-dev \
                       libcairo2-dev
    $ make
    $ make install

 At this point install target have created $HOME/{bin,lib,
share} directories if they do not exists. The flutio
binaries are located in $HOME/bin

    $ flutiou


        Dependencies
        ============

It is wrote in Tcl, with some extensions in C. The gui
uses Tk, cairo and pango.

I use these libraries on my computer for the development:

    libsamplerate 0.1.9
    libsndfile    1.0.28
    tcltk         8.6.10
    libcairo2     1.16.0



        Build/install targets
        =====================

Flutio player daemon only:

    $ make fpd
    $ make install-fpd

Flutio graphical user interface:

    $ make gui
    $ make install-gui

Both:

    $ make
    $ make install


        Build options
        =============

CFLAGS: You can set values to CFLAGS to add for instance
custom include paths (mostly if you have some <somefile.h>
not found errors).

LDFLAGS: You can also set values LDFLAGS to include custom
library paths (if you have kind of "/bin/ld can not find
-lsomething").

Complete example:

    $ make CFLAGS="-Isomeincludedir" LDFLAGS="-Lsomelibdir"


        Install options
        ===============

You can change the default paths for the install target.
There is also a DESTDIR variable for package managers.

Configurable things and their defaults values are:

  prefix  = $(HOME)
  libdir  = $(prefix)/lib
  bindir  = $(prefix)/bin

And these additional options for the gui:

  icondir = $(prefix)/share/icons/hicolor/scallable/apps
  deskdir = $(prefix)/share/applications


Example to prepare flutio for package managers:

    $ make prefix="/usr" DESTDIR="$HOME/mytmpdir" install
